*1) State the goal of your project, ideally including a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious.  This can be an updated version of the section you wrote in the proposal.*

Our plan to make a C library that implements the HTTP spec for handling GET and POST requests is still the same. We should be able to create a basic web application that uses our library’s API to exchange text. Our stretch goal is still implementing functionality for exchanging images or other multimedia content with the web server.

*2) Include a list of each project-related card you completed in Sprints 1 and 2. Annotate each card with a pointer to concrete evidence that the card has been completed (e.g. link to committed code, notes from a reading). If you have cards you can't provide evidence for, or work you did that doesn't have a card, make a note of it and use it to refine your cards for the next sprint.*

We all completed these cards in Sprints 1 & 2: 
Head First C - Exercise 1, which covers C basics
Head First C - Exercise 2, which covers Stacks and Pointers
Head First C - Exercise 2.5, which covers Strings & Regex

We have collectively read Chapters 3, 4, and 5 in Head First C but we’re still trying to apply what we learned to the exercises in class. We’re planning to use class time to check in on our progress and ask clarifying questions about these topics. 

*3) Show preliminary results from your code. Depending on the project this could be a short demo video, example text sequence of commands and outputs, or some other form. Looking ahead to your final report, (updated versions of) these can serve as your usage examples.*

We have results from attempting the web server exercise. We’ll demo this on Monday for our review. 

*4) Demonstrate that you have assembled the resources you need to complete the project.  One good way to do that is to update your annotated bibliography (with a pointer to each resource and a few sentences that describe the content) from the proposal.*

The resources we have needed have not changed.

We can access all the resources we need for this project, including UNIX Network Programming, and Allen provided a web server exercise that we can refer to. Although much of our resources come from Head First C and ThinkOS, we think we'll need the UNIX Network Programming book because it will help us understand how networks are implemented, and the web server exercise is adapted from that book.

Since we're writing a library, we came upon [this link](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/%7Ecampbell/cs50/buildlib.html) that will help us write libraries for C.

We will also use [this website](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) as a guide for the HTTP protocol.


We will use ThinkOS and Head First C to learn C and the basics of how computers and networks work. We will also utilize the exercises for the different chapters as jumping off points for our project.


*5) Present a product backlog for the next sprint that represents a concrete plan that will keep the entire team productively engaged and get you to your stated goals (this can be a link to your Trello board). If you had trouble putting together evidence for your cards in the previous sprints, adjust your new cards accordingly.*

Rather than delegate different web server and library components to different members of the team, we assigned everything to everybody. We still need the whole group to understand the basics of the webserver and practice writing small tools that make up the library. If you look at the “This Sprint” list in our Trello board, we have so much more to learn. We’re hustling on practicing the structs, small tools, and I/O portions of Head First C, but we still need to read through sockets and error handling. 

*6) Enumerate potential roadblocks and ways instructors can help.  Do you need materials? Do you have show-stopping questions you have not been able to answer?*

Based on the progress we have been making, we don’t know when we will feel confident enough or feel that we have enough experience to tackle the actual project. Since the web server uses a lot of concepts throughout the book, we might spend a lot more time than necessary to gain more background.
