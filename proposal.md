*1) State the goal of your project, ideally including a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious.*

We plan to start by making a C library that implements the HTTP spec for handling GET and POST requests. We should be able to create a basic web application that uses our library’s API to exchange text. A stretch goal might be to implement functionality for exchanging images or other multimedia content with the webserver.

*2) Demonstrate that you have acquired the knowledge you need to get started.  We will know that you have this knowledge if the text of the proposal uses domain language effectively to convey ideas clearly and concisely.*


We have been studying C this past few weeks. We have outlined a bunch of topics that are prerequisite knowledge before learning how to implement sockets and the server. Next sprint, we plan to start learning those topics, and eventually culminate in doing the web server exercise. After completing and fully understanding  the web server exercise, we plan to start working on our stretch goal outlined in 1). 

*3) Demonstrate that you have assembled the resources you need to get started.  One good way to do that is to include an annotated bibliography with a pointer (ayyy) to each resource and a few sentences that describe the content.*


We can access all the resources we need for this project, including UNIX Network Programming, and Allen provided a web server exercise that we can refer to. Although much of our resources come from *Head First C* and *ThinkOS*, we think we'll need the UNIX Network Programming book because our project is relevant to networks. 

Since we're writing a library, we came upon [this link](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/%7Ecampbell/cs50/buildlib.html) that will help us write libraries for C. 

We will use ThinkOS and Head First C to learn C and the basics of how computers and networks work. We will also utilize the exercises for the different chapters as jumping off points for our project.

*4) Present a product backlog for the next two sprints that represents a concrete plan that will keep the entire team productively engaged (this can be a link to your Trello board).  Each item in the product backlog should represent a good sized unit of work, and have an appropriate definition of done.*

Unfortunately we are unsure about how to delegate this project work. We’ll have a better idea after we each complete the web server exercise by the end of the second sprint. Until then, we will all be doing the readings and exercises. 

*5) Enumerate potential roadblocks and ways instructors can help.  Do you need materials?  Do you have show-stopping questions you have not been able to answer?*

We think our biggest roadblock would be scheduling. We are all busy with other projects and we’re still uncomfortable with C. We don’t need materials but we need time and concentration to complete this project from start to finish.
