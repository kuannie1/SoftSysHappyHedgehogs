## Content we need to cover:

Big Idea/Abstract

The first thing someone should see when they land on your site is a quick and easily understandable explanation of what your project is all about.

Background

Provide context for your project by describing the broader space in which it is situated. This section will likely draw upon your annotated bibliography. You've already collected this knowledge and shown us you understand it, now frame it for an external audience.

Implementation

What specifically did you accomplish with this project? Within the context of the problem space, enumerate the potential options and explain why you chose what you did. Describe what makes it interesting/challenging, and how you overcame those challenges. Explain your implementation and design decisions with sufficient detail for a technical audience to understand it.

Results

Provide evidence demonstrating that what you built works. Though the details will be different for each project, screenshots and video are likely helpful. Include graphs or other data if appropriate.
